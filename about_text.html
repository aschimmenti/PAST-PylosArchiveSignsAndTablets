Digital approaches to the study of Aegean Scripts are the focus of increasing interest, as shown by the SIGLA database
on Linear A paleography, and DAMOS, an online catalogue of Linear B inscriptions.

The PAST (Pylos Archive Signs and Tablets) project was developed by Andrea Schimmenti inside the INSCRIBE ERC research project (Silvia Ferrara PI).
The resources available in PAST are based on the recent edition of the Archive of Pylos by L. Godart. 
PAST is the result of a creation of a multimedia dataset made of  Linear
B sign attestations with information regarding the position of each sign within each inscription.
The aim of this project was to maximise the benefits of an adaptable, multi-modal set of digital interfaces, while maintaining technical, state-of-the-art
visualisation resources. The main feature of PAST is to be an epigraphic resource, 
dedicated to displaying individually segmented tablets and signs. 
The metadata (transcription of the tablets, information on scribal hands, provenance) 
of the documents on display will be richer later. Still, the site is fully operative  
according to the principle of release early, release often. 
PAST's structure is divided on three "levels": 
- the first lets the user navigate inside the corpus and choose from the
different series a specific inscription or perform a text or metadata search; 
- the second level shows all the signs
attested on the selected inscription ordered by line and position within the line; 
- the third level showcases all the attestations of an individual sign by clicking on it. The reverse search can be performed from the single sign back to the original document. 

In addition, PAST offers a refined search facet on the index, which gives the opportunity to
search inscriptions through an auto-completion function, based on Mycenaean transcriptions (as of now, 
they were extracted by DAMOS via web scraping, but will eventually be based on Godart-Sacconi). 
The search tab was designed to be intuitive without the need for specific guidelines. 
PAST has a twin resource, LAST, based on the same principles of PAST but based on Linear A.

These online resources prove to be very useful tools for researchers and for students, as they not only present the data
in one coherent single location, but are also helpful platforms for the targeted search of attestations, sign shapes,
and epigraphic advanced analyses in general.

Our final endeavour in the development of the PAST and LAST databases will be to mutually
link each resource, in order to create a virtual ecosystem that supports the comparative analysis of all the Aegean
scripts, by cross-referencing information, by tagging specific epigraphic features, and by providing exhaustive
contextual details within an intuitive, accessible, and user-friendly set of platforms.
