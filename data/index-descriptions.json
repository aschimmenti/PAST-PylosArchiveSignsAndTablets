Olivier, on the basis of the etymological interpretation of terms such as <i>mi-ka-ta</i>, literally 'employee at the bar' (cf. mignumi) and <i>pu-ko-wo</i>, literally 'person in charge of lighting the fire' (cf. purkaeus) has proposed to see some individuals as 'shrine attendants'. Some tablets in the An series also record peasants being recruited as fleet rowers. Five tablets of this series are the so-called '<i>o-ka</i> tablets' (An 519, 654, 656, 657 and 661), by the hand of the scribe 1. The term <i>o-ka</i> occurs in them, interpretable as orkha, 'military command' (cf. arx√©) or as okha, 'possession' (cf. exo).",
